How to Use

Prerequesite: you need a Google account to login to this website. 

Our website: https://blooming-refuge-48832.herokuapp.com/

Click on Login. Authenticate yourself through your Google Account. 
Then click on the blue button at the center of the page. Each click is equivalent to an 8oz glass of water. 
Your data is stored in a real-time database on the Mongo servers. 

Future Improvements
In the next version of this app we would:

Increase the loading speed of the page.
Use moment.js to store more events in the database.
Connect to a calendar to provide daily, weekly, monthly reports. 
Take more input from users (weight...).
